An example of how to host an Express.js app on Netlify using
[serverless-http](https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-http). See
[express/server.js](express/server.js) for details, or check it out at
https://merit-express-netlify.netlify.app/!

## To Use on Computer
```bash
# 1. Install node packages using npm
npm install
# 2. Start server-local.js
npm start
```

When you add a page in ```pages/```, you need to specify the route and the filename in [express/routes.js](express/routes.js).
